Remote Access and the Filesystem
1. Install VScode <br />
![Vscode](sc1.png) <br />
* First make sure that the user's computer does not have VSCode installed already
* If not then go to the following website to install [Vscode]((https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* I already had VSCode installed on my computer <br />
2. Remotely Connecting <br />

* first is to install OpenSSH
* * verify that SSh host is connected by running *ssh user@domain@hostname
* Then to connect to the remote computer but using VSCode by opening terminal in VSCode
* In the terminal the command should be ssh cs15lfa22oj@ieng6.ucsd.edu (type yes)
3. Run Some Commands <br />
![commands](sc3.png) <br />
* After ssh-ing run commands
* one example is in the image above which I used the command cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt
4. Moving Files over SSH with scp
* To copy file from personal computer to remote computer use the command scp
** make sure it is run form the client not logged into ieng6
* Creat a file WhereAmI.java <br />
![whereami](whereami.png)<br />
* Run command javac WhereAmi.java / java WhereAmI in client <br />

* Client shows that it runs on window 10 (my laptop) 
* Log into ieng6 and repeat the command above <br />
![sc5](sc5.png)<br />
* Shows that it runs on linux on server
5. SSH Keys
* use ssh-keygen to create a pair of files called public key and private key
* Then copy the public key to .ssh directory of user account on ther server
